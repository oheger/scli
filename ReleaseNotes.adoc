= Release notes

This page contains information about the changes between the different versions
of the SCLI library.

== Release 1.1.0 (2021-10-26)

* It is now possible to mark options as excluding. From the set of affected
  options then only one value is returned. The user can configure whether
  multiple specified values in the excluding options should be treated as a
  failure or if they override each other based on their position on the
  command line.

* The `CliExtractor` type is now covariant in its type parameter. It can
  therefore be used in a more flexible way.

== Release 1.0.0 (2020-09-26)
